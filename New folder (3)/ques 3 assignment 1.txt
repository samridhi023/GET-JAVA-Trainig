Write a Java program that asks the user to enter their birth year, then calculates and prints their current age. Assume the current year is 2024.
         Expected Output: If the user inputs "1990", the program should output: "You are 34 years old."

import java.util.Scanner;

public class AgeCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Current year is fixed as 2024
        int currentYear = 2024;

        // Ask for user input
        System.out.print("Enter your birth year: ");
        int birthYear = sc.nextInt();

        // Calculate age
        int age = currentYear - birthYear;

        // Print result
        System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");

        sc.close();
    }
}
